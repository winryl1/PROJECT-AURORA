# Relations
> [!question]- What are relations?
> It is **any** set of ordered pairs. It is comprised of the *domain* (X) and *range* (Y). 
> It is **written as (X, Y).**

**EXAMPLE (1.1)** ^ex1-1
$$
{(1,3), (2,4), (5,7), (6,8),}
$$
- [I] In this set of relation, the **domain** and **range** are:

| Domain (X) | Range (Y) |
| ---------- | --------- |
| 1          | 3         |
| 2          | 4         |
| 5          | 7         |
| 6          | 8         |
# Functions 
> [!question]- What are functions?
> It is a set of relations with **EXACTLY ONE** output (range).

- [I] Using [[Functions & Relations#^ex1-1]], we can see that each domain has **EXACTLY ONE** range.
- [p] Therefore, this set of relations **is a function.**
---
> [!information]- 
> The basic form of functions is **y=x**. But they can also be written as f(x)=x, where **"f(x)" is basically just y.** t

---
> [!important]- IMPORTANT!
> If a domain has **MORE THAN ONE** range, it is **NOT a function.** But if a **range has multiple domains, it is a function.**

**EXAMPLE (1.2)**
$$
(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1),
$$

| Domain (X) | Range (Y) |
| ---------- | --------- |
| -1         | 0         |
| 0          | 1, -1     |
| 1          | 0         |
- [I] In this example, we see that the **domain "0"** has 2 different ranges. 
- [c] Therefore, this set of relations is **NOT a function**.
