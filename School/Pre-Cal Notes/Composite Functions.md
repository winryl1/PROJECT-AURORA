> [!question] What are Composite Functions? 
> **Composite Functions** is a combination of two or more functions — where the *output of one function becomes the input of another.*

**EXAMPLE**
Let: $f(x)=2x+1; \ \ g(x)=x^2$ 
Find: $f(g(x))$  if  $x=2$

- [I] We are asked to find composite function $f(g(x))$  if  $x=2$. To do this, we first need to find the **output of g(x)**
$$
g(2)=2^2 = 4
$$
- [I] After that, we take the output of g(x) and plug it in f(x).
$$
f(4)=2(4)+1=9
$$
- [p] Therefore, the answer to this example is 9

> We can also write $f(g(x))$  as  $(f∘g)$, which is read as *"f composed with g of x"*. You can also read it as *"To do f, do g first"*.
