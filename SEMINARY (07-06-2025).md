# D&C 71 "Responding to critics of the Savior's Church"
When false information about Joseph Smith and the Church were distributed, the Lord instructed Joseph to proclaim *"my gospel... unto the world in regions round about"* (D&C 71:1-3). The Lord tells Joseph that as He proclaims the gospel, **He will give a portion of His Spirit and power accordingly. He will give us the words to say if we speak in His name (D&C 100:5-7)** 

> *"How does a peacemaker calm and cool the fiery darts? ... We remain confident in our faith, sharing our beliefs with conviction but always void of anger or malice. … Peacemakers are not passive; they are persuasive in the Savior’s way. The strength comes from our faith in Jesus Christ"*
> - Neil L. Andersen

The Lord also teaches us that ***"no weapon that is formed against you shall prosper"* if we stand up for Him.** He also promises that **those who go against His church will be confounded (be proven wrong/defeated).**

However, when we respond to critics, **we must NOT contend with them in anger.**
 
> "*His latter-day work is compromised when contention or enmity exists among His disciples. Jesus Christ explained that His doctrine was not 'to sir up the hearts of men with anger... but [that his] doctrine is that such things should be done away'.* "
> - Dale G. Renlund 

We must remember that we are the disciples of Christ, meaning that **we emulate the life of Jesus Christ.** If we are quick to be offended or become angry, we fail to follow His perfect example. Not only that but **Jesus' very doctrine was one of peace and unity. Jesus does not teach or condone actions that incite anger and strife between people. Jesus NEVER forced anyone to follow Him, rather He wins them over with His love.**
